(**) move the larfg from the Chap5 repo to the repo on QR !!!!
(**) better explain convergence of "orthogonal iteration"
     show what happens when +1,+1, and +1,-1, etc. explain that 
     we converge to a linear combination of q1 and q2 and that's not an eigenvector
     (or do we bounce in the space?) I think we converge to a linear combination.

(**) demonstrate theorem on page 165 to show tthat the convergence rate in orthogonal iteration
     for each eignevector is ( l_i+1 / l_i )^k

What is the speed of convergense of Schur????

Answer the question on page 165: why do we need r=n to come up with a recurrence?
