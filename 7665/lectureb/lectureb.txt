explain mutable struct vs struct
	in short "mutable" is more convenient when developing code, it can be safely removed and probably should
	if not mutable, then all values such as m, n, and the pointers rowptr, colval and nzval cannot be changed
	however the values inside the array of these pointers can be changed
	if mutable the m, n, pointers, of the struct, all this can be changed.

The graph of a triangular (sparse or not) matrix is a DAG.  A directed acyclic
graph (DAG) is a type of graph in which nodes are linked by one-way connections
that do not form any cycles.

Because the graph is a DAG, there exists a topological ordering on the
vertices. After relabelling the vertices with this ordering, we have labelled
vertices 𝑣1,𝑣2,⋯,𝑣𝑛 such that if 𝑣𝑖𝑣𝑗 is a directed edge, then 𝑖<𝑗.  Now,
entry 𝐴𝑖𝑗 of the adjacency matrix is nonzero when there is an edge from 𝑣𝑖 to
𝑣𝑗. We want to show that 𝐴 is an (upper) triangular matrix. Formally, this
means its entries below the main diagonal are zero. Moreover, entries 𝐴𝑖𝑗 below
the main diagonal are precisely the elements with 𝑖>𝑗.
