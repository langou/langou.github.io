== C ==

I need to write some checks here, maybe I should call BLAS?

== PYTHON ==

It would be nice to compare with scipy, scipy has access to a triangular solve
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.solve_triangular.html

== JULIA ==

It would be nice to vectorize as well the julia code. (Similar to what was done
in Python.) And then check the performance
