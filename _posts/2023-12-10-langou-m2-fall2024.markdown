**instructor:** Julien Langou

**course title:** Numerical Linear Algebra

**description:** Numerical Linear Algebra is at the foundation of many
scientific computation. This course introduces the techniques, analysis
methods, and implementation details of numerical linear algebra. The course
emphasizes the link between theoretical concepts, algorithm formulation, and
practical implementation. The class will cover the main matrix algorithms for
LU, QR, Cholesky, LDLT, linear least squares, Schur form, diagonalization,
symmetric and nonsymmetric eigenvalue problems, and singular value
decomposition. During this journey, we will study (1) the theory of error
analysis, condition number, forward and backward error, (2) how to write
implementations in term of matrix-matrix multiplication so as to get
efficiency, (3) the amount of memory transfer between different level of memory
during a computation, (4) parallel implementations of these algorithms using
MPI or task-based programming, (5) an introduction to randomized linear algebra
techniques.

**evaluation** The class will have (1) quizes to assess students learning of
the theory, and (2) programming assignments to assess students learning of the
practice.

**bibliography** The course will rely on research articles in the area. For
