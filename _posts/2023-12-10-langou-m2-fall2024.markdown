**instructor:** Julien Langou

**course title:** Numerical Linear Algebra

**description:** Linear algebra is one of the fundamental techniques underlying
multiple mathematical disciplines. Correspondingly, numerical linear algebra is
the foundation of scientific computation. This course introduces the basic
techniques, analysis methods, and implementation details of numerical linear
algebra. The course emphasizes the strong link between theoretical concepts,
algorithm formulation, and practical implementation that leads to the ubiquity
of numerical linear algebra in applications. Recent progress in machine
learning is based to a large degree on extending concepts from numerical linear
algebra and will be discussed in the course.

**course goals** Upon course completion students:
- will be proficient in the basic operations of numerical linear algebra;
- will understand the significance of the main matrix factorizations;
- will be proficient in construction of linear subspaces;
- will be able to determine the computational complexity of numerical linear
  algebra algorithms;
- understand the links between numerical linear algebra operations and other
  fields of numerical analysis, in particular, approximation theory;
- will be able to implement numerical linear algebra algorithms.
