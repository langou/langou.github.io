      "Getting Started" Colab at: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16mdKtiOJnNOemxN0FGB1l_JzvDflOMeW">Reality Check 2 - The Euler–Bernoulli Beam (COLAB)</a>

Some comments:

(*) First there are two parts in Homework #7: (1) a (typed or handwritten) part
and (2) a colab part.  I initially had written “Please only turn in a colab
notebook. There are some questions that need to be answer by writing, but
please do this in colab directly by using “text” mode. Do not turn in any
handwritten work.” Then I decided that it would be better to have both (1) a
(typed or handwritten) part and (2) a colab part. But I forgot to remove the
text.
 
If you want to only turn in a colab notebook where you type the long answers in
colab, that’s OK. If you prefer to hand write the long answer, do as you
prefer. So bottom line: it is OK to submit “typed or handwritten” work.
 
The suggestion is: 
(--) question 1 is handwritten or typed.  
(--) question 2 is colab.  
(--) question 3 is a mix of (handwritten or typed ) and (colab).  
(--) question 4 is handwritten or typed.  
(--) question 5 is a mix of (handwritten or typed ) and (colab).
 
(*) You might be asking yourself, for question 4, what numerical value for p we
need to use. Indeed, it is not said what numerical value of p we should  use.
In question 5, we are tasked to use p=100 kg/m. Please use same value for
question 4.

(*) In question 4, we need to check that the formula for y(x) is a solution for
the problem. So given the right hand side made of (1) the weight of the beam
itself and (2) a sinusoidal pile to the beam, so this is f(x) = -480 w d ( PLUS
) s(x) (as given in question 4), we want to check that Equation 2.27 
    E I (d^4 y / dx^4 ) = f(x) + s(x) 
is satisfied for y(x) as given in question 4. (So we need to differentiate y
four times and check. This is a Calculus I question.) We also need to check
that the clamped-free beam condition are satisfied.  
Namely: y(0) = 0 and ( d y / dx ) ( 0 ) = 0 and ( d^2 y / dx^2 ) ( L ) = 0 
and ( d^3 y / dx^3 ) ( L ) = 0.
 
Question 4 is about checking that the analytical solution given satisfies our
problem. There is no programming. Just Calculus.
 
p is anything. It is a parameter. (So it is a constant with respect to x.)
 
Note: you are asked to check that the analytical solution given satisfies our
problem. You are not asked to prove that this is the unique solution to this
problem. This is a good question to ask. But it is not asked.
 
(4) For question #1,
 
you should get a plot that looks like this:
<a href="realitycheck_2_q_2_________sauer3____plot1.pdf">good plot (PDF)</a>

you should not get a plot that looks like this:
<a href="realitycheck_2_q_2_________sauer3____plot2.pdf">bad plot (PDF)</a>

The red dot (computed solution with n=10) should be exactly (up to machine
precision) on the red line (exact closed-form solution). The computed solution
is EXACTLY (up to machine precision) the exact solution. If you get something
like <a href="realitycheck_2_q_2_________sauer3____plot2.pdf">bad plot (PDF)</a>, this is likely because our
vector “x" should not start at x=0 but the vector “x” starts at x=h (or
equivalently at x=L/n).
 
We want n points from 1/n to L by steps of L/n. One way to do it is: x =
np.linspace( h, L, n) We do not want n points from 0 to L by steps of L/(n-1).
So if you do something like: x = np.linspace( 0, L, n) this is likely going to
result in a plot like <a href="realitycheck_2_q_2_________sauer3____plot2.pdf">bad plot (PDF)</a>.  In other
words, we get the first point (0,0) for “free” and we have to manually add it
in. The point x=0 is not part of the solution. (It is implicitly there.)
 
As usual, let me know if questions.

The Computer Project #2 is The Euler–Bernoulli Beam. This is page 102-105 of the book. See reality check #2.

You need to do question 1 through 5. DO NOT DO 6, 7 and 8. And you have the Question 6 below:

Question #6. Compare full format versus sparse format.

(1) Do a “scalability"' study of the solve. That is: time the solve (using tic/toc commands) (in both cases full format and sparse format) as a function of n. (n is the size of the matrix.)
As n increases, how does the time to solution increase in either case?

(2) Compare as well the memory requirement in both cases. How does the memory needed for your application grow as a function of n?

Some comments. These comments should make sense once you read the whole question and have thought about it. If this makes no sense at a first read, this is OK. Please read the question first!

Comments:

(1) In Question #2. "Plot the solution from Step 1 against the correct solution y(x) = (f/24EI) etc. "
=> For  (f/24EI) please understand ( f / 24 / E / I ) OK?

(2) For Question #6: please go easy on your laptop. N=1,000 in FULL format should be fine with most of your laptops. N=10,000 : some laptop will crash, those who do not will take a LONG time. N = 100,000 is NOT FEASIBLE in a laptop. 
If you SPARSE format you should be able to tackle 10,000 no sweat, and 100,000 should be doable on most laptops. So PLEASE TAKE IT EASY WITH N on your LAPTOPS. Last year, it was crash/reboot/crash/reboot. 

(3) For Question #4. What value of p in question 4 shall we take? It is not said what value of p we should  take.

So in question 5, we ask you to use p=100 kg/m. And you need to do a computer simulation with this value of p. We need a value of p to do a simulation. This is question 5. Question 4 (the one we speak about) does not need a value for p.

In question 4, you need to check that the formula for y(x) is a solution for the problem. 
So given the right hand side made of (1) the weight of the beam itself and (2) a sinusoidal pile to the beam, so this f(x) = -480 w d ( PLUS ) s(x) (as given in question 4), we want to check that 
Equation 2.27 
	E I (d^4 y / dx^4 ) = f(x) + s(x) 
is satisfied for y(x) as given in question 4. (So you need to differentiate y four times and check. This is a Calculus I question.)
You also need to check that the clamped-free beam condition are satisfied. 
Namely: y(0) = 0 and ( d y / dx ) ( 0 ) = 0 and ( d^2 y / dx^2 ) ( L ) = 0 and ( d^3 y / dx^3 ) ( L ) = 0.

So question 4 is about checking that the analytical solution given satisfies our problem. There is no programming. Just Calculus.

p is anything. It is a parameter. (So it is a constant with respect to x.)

Note: you are asked to check that the analytical solution given satisfies our problem. You are not asked to prove that this is the unique solution to this problem. This is a good question to ask. But it is not asked. 

(4) For Question #2. 

You should get the Figure2.png. That the computed solution is EXACTLY (1e-16) the exact solution. If you get something like Figure1.png, this is because the vector “x" does not start at x=0 but the vector x starts at x=1/n. 
You want n points from 1/n to 1 by steps of 1/n.  (this is what you have when you do: x = linspace(1/n,l,n); )
You do not want n points from 0 to 1 by steps of 1/(n-1). (this is what you have when you do: x = linspace(0,l,n); )
In other words, we get (0,0) for “free” and have to manually add it in.
