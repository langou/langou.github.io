Comments for CP.2.7.5.b:

(1) In CP.2.7.5.a, Sauer gives solution. In CP.2.7.5.b, Sauer does not give you
the solutions for this problem. So you can remove the ``box`` that starts with
# Per Sauer, we have two exact solution x1 and 2 such that
The two solutions are actually not too hard to write analytically. First one
starts with (17/9, . . . ) and second one starts with ( 1, . . .) I am not sure
why Sauer does not give them, but it might be good for you to try to figure
this out.

(2) Do not forget to square your radii!!! In CP.2.7.5.a all radii are 1. So you
do not see the 1^2 very much. Do not forget to square the radii.

(3) I think my loop for Newton is 6 iterations as a default. If you see some
convergence at step 6 but do not 1e-14 accuracy, do not hesitate to increase
the number of iterations a tat. For me for problem CP.2.7.5.b, I needed 11
iterations. This is OK. It depends on your starting point. I think I was little
far, so Newton spent 5 iterations bouncing around and not really converging,
and then it finally decided to converge and I had a nice quadratic convergence
with errors like 1e-1, 1e-2, 1e-4, 1e-8, and 1e-16. So once you are in the
``locally quadratically convergent`` region this works fine, but it might take
some bouncing around to find this region. This is OK.
